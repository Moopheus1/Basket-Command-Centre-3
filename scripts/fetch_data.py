"""Fetch bars + fundamentals for all tickers in tickers.txt and write docs/data.json.

Runs in GitHub Actions (see .github/workflows/update-data.yml), 34x/weekday:
  - FETCH_MODE=eod:       full 430-day history + fundamentals, for every ticker.
                           Used for the once-daily 16:30 ET run, and as the
                           fallback for manual/push-triggered runs and for the
                           very first run ever (no docs/data.json to build on).
  - FETCH_MODE=intraday:  lightweight — pulls only today's 1-minute bars,
                           synthesizes a single "today" OHLCV bar from them,
                           and merges it into the EXISTING docs/data.json's
                           bar history (replacing today's bar if already
                           present, appending it if not). Skips tk.info()
                           entirely, since sector/industry/mcap/beta/
                           nextEarnings don't change intraday - those fields
                           are carried over unchanged from the last EOD fetch.

Design intent: the heavy call (.history(period="430d") + .info) only happens
once a day. The other 33 daily runs each do one lightweight 1-minute pull per
ticker with no fundamentals call, to avoid hammering Yahoo with the same
430-day + company-profile payload every 10 minutes.

On a per-ticker failure in intraday mode, the existing entry is left
untouched (stale but valid) rather than overwritten with an error stub -
a transient miss during the day shouldn't blank out a ticker that has
perfectly good EOD data. EOD mode keeps the original stricter behavior:
a failure there does write an error stub, since that's the once-daily
authoritative refresh and a silent stale entry would hide a real problem.
